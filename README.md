# Globe Guessr

This repository uses React + Typescript + Vite

This is a work in progress. Currently you can view a globe in 3D. Clicking on any country on the globe will log some information regarding that country to the console.

Next steps are to shape this into a sort of reverse geo guessr game, where users can 
- guess where certain coordinates are on the globe
- click on a country name when prompted with one
- click on a country that corresponds to certain attributes such as country size, or number of inhabitants
- do this in multiplayer mode
